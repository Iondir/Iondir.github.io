    <p class ="page-description"> So this blog is just a little something i want to try out. I have not played or really seen any PSO content before the NA release,
        So I'm planning on posting my journey here</p>




    <h3 class = "subtitle"> Entering PSO2</h3>
    <p class = "text">As it turned out, I didnt go with the original design. I usually end up going with a female avatar 
        due to most mmo's having more customizable features for female characters. I originally wanted to finally start with 
        a male avatar, but after searching online, I've decided to put it off for a bit. After my second atempt at creating my character,
        which may of taken a few hours, I finished the tutorial and waited for one of my friends to finish. While waitiing for him, I ended up 
        striking a conversation with a few people in the spawn. Even when my friend got on, we ended up spending another hour or so 
        before me and my friend decided to go and finally start questing. Before we left tho, we were invited to the group's alliance to ask them any questions.
        By the time we started questing, it was about 2AM in the morning, so we called it after a few quests.
