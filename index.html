          <h3 class="subtitle">Starting the New Change</h3><p class="date">Monday, August 10 2020</p>
          <p class="text">I have a tiny problem...... I can't seem to decide how i want to title these posts. I could try comming up with some kind of title for them, or I can just
              have the date be the "title". Well I might experiment with both of those and see what I prefer. Anyways, today was the day where I decided to change the format of the 
              website. Of course I still have the files for the previous version, but I wanted to try something more... modern feelish for a blog. As you can tell, the entire screen 
              isn't filled up with text, and now has that generic blog feeling. With this, I can attempt to some more features, like the side nav box to the left. I figured I might 
              as well make it so it will go to the begining of each month to make it traversing the blog, if for some reason someone wants to go read from a certain point or whatever.
              it's mainly there because I wanted to implement one after seeing some websites do it. I definelty prefer the type that stays in place while scrolling, it just makes it 
              easier to use. At the moment, the website.. kinda looks like trash since I'm not caring about looks rn. I might do a few touch ups in a bit, but the colors rn are just so 
              I can get a better look how everything is displayed, formated, and how it fits. Anyways, besides from coding, I was watching Noahj456's and MrTLexify's streams of them 
              opening up Activision's crates, and trying to figure out the puzzel of the first Call of Duty 2020 teaser. It's honestly so fun to watch, since it was basically another 
              easter egg hunt for them. After they solved it, I had Lex's stream in the background while I started to think how I was going to start the new changes to the website. 
              Also, on a side note, I highly recomend Lex's video he made which is a summary of the begining of the stream, which can be found 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxRDMPJzkio">HERE</a> 
              . Anyways, the other main thing I sprinkled in today was just doing a few quests and watching a concert in pso2. Honeslty I will never get tired of attending them, even 
              though it's the same songs, the community is the gold lining to it. To be honest, the community in this game is one of the main reasons I log on everyday. A decent 
              portion of the time, I'll be on afking in a popular area just watching and reading the stuff going on in the lobby. I guess that's all to talk about today, so I'm  gonna
              get back to doing a bit more coding before calling it a day. Until tomorrow~
          </p>

          <!-- SUNDAY, AUGUS 9 2020-->
          <h3 class = "subtitle" id="August">Update</h3><p class="date">Sunday, August 9 2020</p>
          <p class="text"> So it turns out I have a tiny problem with staying commited to projects, just not games hahaha. I did plan on updating this whenever I finished a session
              but so much has just been happening in the past few months. I've been honestly finding it hard to stay keep any passion or goal I set for myself right now. I always end
              up finding something I want to do, try it for a short period of time, then lose all motivation to continue. It honestly is such a sucky feeling. I've done a bit of video 
              recording, some video edditing, took a free online HTML class, and I think something esle but I cant seem to remember it. I did plan posting the few videos I've attempted 
              to "edit" to youtube, but it would take forever with my internet and just slow it down, so that's not an option at the momment. Even though the eddit ....edit... why does
              Enlgish words look sooooooo wierd sometimes... and I only know how to speak English too..... anyways edditing videos was a really fun experience, and I could see how some
              people can put so much time and effort into it. I just feel like I lack the creativity for activites like that hahaha. Originally, this website was going to be what I use 
              to constanly work on my web design skills, because I'm intrested in making this my career in the future. Right now, I'm a Computer Science student about to go into their 
              third year of college and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing with my life. I've been doing decent in school recently, but nothing's come out of it yet. Nothing 
              from school has sparked any passion or idea. Not to mention, I have literally zero job experience... and I'm turning 20 soon.... which is honeslty kind of depressing. 
              Sure, in this situations the U.S. is in, it's not horrible. I've been applying to jobs, and this summer has been an improvement compared to the past year of appying to 
              jobs. I've been getting alot of job interview, so I'm just happy about that improvement. However, I've still yet to land a job... up until my most recent job interview, 
              my anxiety was always there.. and sometimes getting the best of me.... which I'm sure didn't look good when I'm applying to a part time job that involves dealing with the 
              public. I'm sure I'll land a job sooner or later. Each interview I go to gives me something to reflect on and to improve on. While I'm a sad that I wasn't able to get a job
              durring this summer break, I'm still going to keep at it until I get one. Hahaha, sorry for doing a tiny bit of venting. 
          </p>
          <h4>So what's happening to this website?</h4>
          <p class="text">
              Originally, this website was going to be mainly me talking about PSO2 and maybe branching into another game or two,but was mainly a place to test new and different things
              revolving around website design to improve my skills. As I stated earlier in that gaint ramble above, I lost motivation for updating and learning new stuff. So what I plan
              on dong is just making this place a blog for my general life. That way I alawys have something I can post about. Hopefully in the future when I have the skills to do so, 
              I'll be able make it so people could have small discussions and whatever but thats way in the future. So yea, I'm going to try to make at least a new post a day, and maybe 
              try a few changes out and whatever. I'm gonna stop myself here before i end up with another giant paragraph with no end in sight.

        <p class ="page-description"> So this blog is just a little something i want to try out. I have not played or really seen any PSO content before the NA release,
            So I'm planning on posting my journey here</p>

        <h3 class = "subtitle" id="June"> The Wait </h3><p class = "date">Saturday, June 6 2020</p>
        <p class = "text"> As I've mentioned before, I've been playing with a friend, well I was planning to. Unfortunately, it seems that his game unistalled itself,
            and is now giving him problems when attempting to re-install. He's hoping it will get fixed in the next maitnance patch. Since I dont want to get too far ahead,
            I have mainly limited myself to playing in the cassino, which isnt too hard to do. I seriously need to get myself a blacknyack card set irl.
        </p>

        <!-- SECOND-->
           <h3 class = "subtitle"> Entering PSO2</h3>
           <p class = "text">As it turned out, I didnt go with the original design. I usually end up going with a female avatar 
           due to most mmo's having more customizable features for female characters. I originally wanted to finally start with 
            a male avatar, but after searching online, I've decided to put it off for a bit. After my second atempt at creating my character,
            which may of taken a few hours, I finished the tutorial and waited for one of my friends to finish. While waitiing for him, I ended up 
            striking a conversation with a few people in the spawn. Even when my friend got on, we ended up spending another hour or so 
            before me and my friend decided to go and finally start questing. Before we left tho, we were invited to the group's alliance to ask them any questions.
            By the time we started questing, it was about 2AM in the morning, so we called it after a few quests.
